## Welcome to my blog!

There is a long road ahead for me. I'm currently learning and sharing back all what I've got from the community.
I will try to post as much as I do, as complete as possible, knowing that sometimes, I won't be clear. In that case, you can ask anything at the comments.


## CTF Writeups

CTF (Capture The Flag) are competitions where we solve different cibersecurity tasks to find the secret (flag) at the end of the challenge. There are several categories depending on the type of the challenge, some of them are: Web, Forensic, OSINT (Open Source Intelligence), Cryptography, PWN (Binary Explotation), Reverse Engineering, RF (Radio Frequency), Hardware, etc. 

I have special interest in OSINT, Web and Forensic challenges and I participate with team [ISwearIGoogledIt](https://ctftime.org/team/109689) looking for scoring as much points as possible while developing new skills in different cybersecurity areas.

You can find all my CTFs writeups (solutions and explanations) here: [Kashmir54's CTF Writeups](/ctfs)
