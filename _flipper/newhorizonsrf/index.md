## Intro

Long time ago I was experimenting with the UHF Tags, a cheap solution that is almost everywhere now. A year ago I discovered the [uhf_rfid repo](https://github.com/frux-c/uhf_rfid) an outstanding project mainly developed by [frux-c](https://github.com/frux-c), where it created a Flipper Zero application to interface with RFID Tags using the YRM100X modules.

The project is still on development and there are many functionallity working and other is still ongoing, hopefully with this tool more people might find this field interesting and could contribute to it. For the application capabilities and functionallity, I encourage you to visit the [repo's README](https://github.com/frux-c/uhf_rfid?tab=readme-ov-file) to see what's going on.

While working with cables directly connected to the modules and back, I had issues with some of them getting disconnected or making a bad connection, that's why I developed this quick board to enhance experience while looking cool 😉 I think.

If you are reading this, it is because I have some units 🟢 **in stock**. If you are interested in getting the board or the module, you can [contact me](mailto:kashmir_54@hotmail.com). Check out the [bundles and boards](#bundles-and-boards) to see the options.

# Bundles and Boards

If you are interested in getting the board or the complete module, you can [contact me](mailto:kashmir_54@hotmail.com) on my email kashmir_54@hotmail.com and I will get back to you! If you read this, that's because I have some 🟢 **in stock!**. Please, read the page carefully and bear in mind that this is an experimental module, while it does its job and connects the module to the corresponding pins, the Flipper apps are still on developement. This is not a big button tool, but an entry point for enthusiast to get into UHF RFID and potentially, contribute the [uhf_rfid](https://github.com/frux-c/uhf_rfid) project.
