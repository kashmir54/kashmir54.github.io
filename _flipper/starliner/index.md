## Description

The StarLinerIR is an infrared (IR) devboard with 8 IR LEDs, 4 of them are enhanced for an outstanding range improvement. The LEDs are a combination of the usual infrared wavelengths used in most devices: 850nm and 940nm.

The enhanced IR LEDs are rated at 0.5W each, this way the IR beam gets enough power to reach long distances without harming Flipper battery due to high power draw.

The boarf comes with a switch to power a white LED that can be used as a mini flash light.

Main features of this VoyagerRF Pro version:

- ⚡️ **Long range:** The IR beam created by the 8 LEDs increase the range from the inbuilt IR led in the Flipper.
- ⚡️ **Mini flashlight:** The board comes with a switch to light up an status white LED that can be used as a mini flashlight.
- ⚡️ **Manually soldered and tested**, I like to solder, so I prefer to build it myself to maximize quality.
- ⚡️ **Flat fit**, for optimal form factor. It's mounted horizontally, wide enough for easy removal.
- ⚡️ **3D Printed case:** For people looking for a clean look, I designed a case to store and carry your StarLinerIR everywhere.
