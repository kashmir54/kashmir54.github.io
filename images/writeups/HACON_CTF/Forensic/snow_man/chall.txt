This is the anthem   	 	       	 			  	  
Told the world I need everything and some, yeah 	       		       
Two girls that's a tandem      	      	       	   	  	       	     
She gon' do it all for me when them bands come   	    	    
Got it all, yeah I'm young, rich, and handsome	  	   	    	    
Uh, this shit is not random      	       	   		     	    
Everybody ain't got it, understand son    	    	  	      	      
Yeah, this shit is not random	 	  	      	     	   	 

Woah, okay
It's my world and I do what I like to
I know she gon' be ready when I slide through
If you forgot I got it, I'll remind you (remind you)
'Cause I got what they got, I'm talkin' times two
Disagree with me and you've been lied to
I am nothing like you, and no I'm not the type to
Follow bullshit y'all give the hype to
I can see the fakes, so when I look in your direction
Understand I'm seein' right through
You're hollow, you follow?
Everybody's not the real McCoy
Worldwide, yeah, they feel the boy
California out to Georgia, Florida, then up to Illinois
When I listen to your music, I just feel annoyed
Haters, I don't understand 'em
Bred Jordan ones from 2001 (OG)
Today I think I want a Phantom
If I don't get it I'ma throw a fuckin' tantrum, whoa!
